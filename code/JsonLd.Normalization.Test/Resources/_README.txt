The files contained in this folder come from JSON-LD 1.1 specification tests (version tagged REC-2020-07-16) on github https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/tree/REC-2020-07-16/tests/toRdf

Files in the folder "normalized" have been processed by "code/jsonld.js-normalizer/normalize_documents.js" (powershell: node code/jsonld.js-normalizer/normalize_documents.js code/JsonLd.Normalization.Test/Resources/jsonld-canonicalization) which is using jsonld.js (v5.2.0) library internally. 
Not all source files could be normalized successfully with this method, so they are missing their corresponding files in the "normalized" folder.
